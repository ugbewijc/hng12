<h1 style="text-align: center;">Stage 0 Backend - Develop a Public API to Retrieve Basic Information<h1>

## Task Description

Develop a public API that returns the following information in JSON format:
- Your registered email address (used to register on the HNG12 Slack workspace).
- The current datetime as an ISO 8601 formatted timestamp.
- The GitHub URL of the project's codebase.

### Requirements

#### Technology Stack:
- Programming Language/Framework: Use any of the following: C Sharp (C#), PHP, Python, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Deployment: The API must be deployed to a publicly accessible endpoint.
- CORS Handling: Ensure the API handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) appropriately.
- Response Format: All responses must be in JSON format.

#### Version Control:
- Repository Hosting: Host the code on GitHub.
- Repository Visibility: The repository must be public.
- Documentation: Include a well-structured README.md file

#### API Specification
- Endpoint: GET** <your-url>
- Required JSON Response Format (200 OK):
    ```json
    {
    "email": "your-email@example.com",
    "current_datetime": "2025-01-30T09:30:00Z",
    "github_url": "<https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo>"
    }
    ```
#### Acceptance Criteria
**Functionality**
- The API must accept GET requests and return the required JSON response.
- The current_datetime field must be dynamically generated in ISO 8601 format (UTC).
- Provides appropriate HTTP status code

**Code Quality**
- Organized code structure.

**Documentation**
- README.md must include:
  - A clear description of the project.
  - Setup instructions (e.g., how to run the project locally).

- API documentation, including:
  - Endpoint URL.
  - Request/response format.
  - Example usage.

- Backlinks to:
  - https://hng.tech/hire/python-developers
  - https://hng.tech/hire/csharp-developers
  - https://hng.tech/hire/golang-developers
  - https://hng.tech/hire/php-developers
  - https://hng.tech/hire/java-developers
  - https://hng.tech/hire/nodejs-developers

**Deployment**
- The API must be deployed to a publicly accessible endpoint.
- The API should have a fast response time (< 500ms).
